# info_526_visualization
Instruction: The total number of points assigned to your final project submission is 20, distributed as follows:
-   2 points for a working link to GitHub
>> link to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/dkangsimUA/info_526_visualization/ 
-   2 points for a description of the data and where the data was acquired
>> I used the `birthweight` data that was collected at the Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts during 1986. The data is provided in the MASS package and can be aquired with the following code: `data = MASS:birthwt`; its description can be accessed through ?MASS::birthwt. 
-   6 points, divided into 2 points for each of three plots (for a total of three different types of plot, from the different types we've seen in class)
>> Using the `birthwt` data, I have applied the following three plots: 1) Uniformed Manifold Approximation and Porjection for dimensaionl reduction technique; 2) tSNA; 3) Principal component analsysis. 
-   2 points for the use of colorblind-friendly color schemes
-   2 points for the use of the appropriate color scheme (categorical, divergent, or continuous) given the variable mapped to the color/fill aesthetics
-   2 points for appropriate axes scales and labels (meaning they are legible, not overlapping, and clearly state what is being displayed in the plot)
-   2 points for titles and captions that make it clear what the plot is
    about
-   2 points for appropriate ordering of group levels (examples: unordered categorical variables are displayed not according to alphabetical order, but reordered by the numeric variable used; ordered categorical variables are shown in their correct order)
